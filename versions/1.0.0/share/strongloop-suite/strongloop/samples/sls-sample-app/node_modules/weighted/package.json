  "readme": "# weighted\n\nA dead-simple module for picking a random item from a set, with weights. Extremely useful for bot scripting.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt's on NPM:\n\n    npm install weighted\n\n## Usage\n\n### Selection Function\n\nWeighted returns a Function additionally available as `weighted.select`:\n\n    weighted.select(set, weights, [rand])\n    weighted.select(obj, [rand])\n\nSelections can be made based on either a pair of Arrays or a single Object, like so:\n\n#### Array Version\n\n    var weighted = require('weighted')\n\n    var options = ['Wake Up', 'Snooze Alarm']\n      , weights = [0.25, 0.75]\n\n    console.log('Decision:', weighted.select(options, weights))\n\n#### Object Version\n\n    var weighted = require('weighted')\n\n    var options = {\n    \t  'Wake Up': 0.25,\n    \t  'Snooze Alarm': 0.75\n    \t}\n\n    console.log('Decision:', weighted.select(options))\n\n### Overriding Rand\n\nBy default, `weighted.select` uses Math.random() for selection. This can be overridden by providing a Function as the third, `rand`, parameter:\n\n    var weighted = require('weighted')\n      , mersenne = require('mersenne')\n\n    var options = ['Wake Up', 'Snooze Alarm']\n      , weights = [0.25, 0.75]\n\n    function rand() {\n      return mersenne.rand() / 32768\n    }\n\n    console.log('Decision:', weighted.select(options, weights, rand))\n\n## A Note on Weights\n\nVersion 0.1 required that all weights add up to exactly 1. As of version 0.2 this is no longer required, simply recommended.\n\n## A Note on Performance\n\nWeighted is optimized for selection, especially repeated selection over the same Arrays of actions and weights. See the output and source of `npm run-script bench` for details.\n\n## Thanks\n\n * The AI folks at 38 Studios for teaching me just how \"intelligent\" random activity can seem.\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright (C) 2012 Michael Schoonmaker (michael.r.schoonmaker@gmail.com)\n\n    This project is free software released under the MIT/X11 license:\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
