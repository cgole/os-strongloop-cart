  "readme": "# shuffle\n\nShuffle is a node.js package for shuffling and dealing decks of cards (or anything else you'd like to shuffle).\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TroyGoode/node-shuffle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/TroyGoode/node-shuffle)\n\n## Installation (via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/shuffle))\n\n```bash\n$ npm install shuffle\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nUsing shuffle is simple:\n\n```javascript\nvar Shuffle = require('shuffle');\nvar deck = Shuffle.shuffle();\nvar card = deck.draw();\n```\n\nAlternatively you can draw multiple cards at once:\n\n```javascript\nvar hand = deck.draw(5);\n```\n\nYou can also use it to deal cards to multiple hands:\n\n```javascript\nvar player1, player2, player3, player4;\ndeck.deal(5, [player1, player2, player3, player4]);\n```\n\nThe above deals a card to player #1 then player #2 then player #3 then player #4 then back again to player #1 until each player has five cards.\n\nIf you need to reset and reshuffle the deck, it is as easy as:\n\n```javascript\ndeck.reset(); //sets the deck back to a full 52-card deck, unshuffled\ndeck.shuffle();\n```\n\n## More Stuff\n\nYou don't have to shuffle standard playing cards. You can shuffle other stuff too:\n\n```javascript\nvar Shuffle = require('shuffle');\nvar goFish = [{color: 'red', number: 1}, {color: 'blue', number: 2}, ...];\nvar deck = Shuffle.shuffle({deck: goFish});\n```\n\nYou can also supply your own randomizer so that you can supply a custom seed:\n\n```javascript\nvar Shuffle = require('shuffle');\nvar srand = require('srand'); //https://github.com/isaacs/node-srand (npm install srand)\nsrand.seed(1000);\nvar deck = Shuffle.shuffle({random: function(){ return srand.random(); }});\n```\n\nOther deck methods:\n\n```javascript\ndeck.drawFromBottomOfDeck() // 1 card\ndeck.drawFromBottomOfDeck(5) // array of 5 cards\n\ndeck.drawRandom() // 1 card\ndeck.drawRandom(5) // array of 5 cards\n\ndeck.putOnTopOfDeck(card)\ndeck.putOnTopOfDeck([card, card, card])\n\ndeck.putOnBottomOfDeck(card)\ndeck.putOnBottomOfDeck([card, card, card])\n\ndeck.length // integer (# of cards left in deck)\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\n## Author\n\n[Troy Goode](https://github.com/TroyGoode) ([troygoode@gmail.com](mailto:troygoode@gmail.com))\n",
