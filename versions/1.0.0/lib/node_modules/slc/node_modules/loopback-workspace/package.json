  "readme": "# Loopback Workspace\n\nEach Workspace manages a directory of Loopback Projects for a user, team, or organization. Workspace can be used either\nprogrammatically, or through a built-in REST interface.\n\n## Running the REST server\n\nAfter cloning the Workspace repository, run the following:\n\n    node workspace --root `~/my-loopback-workspace`\n\nOf course, this example assumes the repo is cloned at `./workspace`, and that the desired root directory for projects is\n`~/my-loopback-workspace`. Please make any appropriate changes for your own use.\n\n## Using Workspaces programmatically\n\nTODO\n\n## Extending the Workspace\n\nNew factories can be added to Workspace through the `factories` directory of. When a new Module is added to a Project,\nthe `type` parameter of the body is used to determine which factory to load, by name. For example, if there's a factory\nnamed `app` installed, a new Module from the following body would use that factory:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"MyModule\",\n  \"type\": \"app\",\n  \"port\": 5050\n}\n```\n\nEach factory consists of a legal Node module that exports a Function. That Function should extend the `Factory`\ninterface that Workspace provides, extending `render()` and `dependencies()` as necessary. (Otherwise, that would be a\nvery body Factory, indeed.)\n",
